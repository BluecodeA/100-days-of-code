# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 02, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Adapted my pre-existing project for GitHub. Used Git Bash. Uploaded on GitHub Pages

**Thoughts:** I understood how my Codepen projects are not ready to be deployed on the web, and the kind of changes that need to be done to make it work outside that environment. I tried to upload the files on GitHub using the command line. I was able to add and commit the file, but I was so disappointed at being unable to push. I ended up uploading via the web version of GitHub, vowing to get better with the command line soon.

### Day 2: January 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Write HTML/CSS for my Twitch app

**Thoughts**: I used HTML5 tags for the first time. I used SCSS variables for the first time. Still found using HTML5 tags a hinderance to using simple div's, but I am completely sold out on the SASS front. I am excited about the ways in which I can use in in the future.

### Day 3: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Write HTML/CSS and JavaScript for my Twitch app

**Thoughts**: As an added functionality, I wished to add an option to view the 'Top Games' on Twitch in my app. I worked on the HTML/CSS for that. I had written some jQuery AJAX calls already, today I touched up some of them. Apart from this I went through some video tutorials for git.

### Day 4: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Write HTML/CSS and JavaScript for my Twitch app

**Thoughts**: Today I set out to complete the 'Top Games' section of my Twitch Watch app, and I did just that. Yesterday I had sorted out the HTML/CSS behind it. Today I used jQuery and JavaScript to update it in real time using the Twitch API. Felt good to set a target and achieve it.

### Day 5: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Write HTML/CSS and JavaScript for my Twitch app

**Thoughts**: I was able to finalise on a format and design for my user streams section of my Twitch app. I would've been more pleased if i could've completed the JS part needed to make this section fully ready so that the only thing left was to receive and display API data, but not to be.

### Day 6: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learnt how to not give up after screwing up

**Thoughts**: I prepared the JS using jQuery to add the data I received from my API AJAX call. The code worked alright for streams that were online. But for streams that were not certain data was missing (which I should've noticed earlier). So when I set out to fix it, at some point I decided to put my AJAX calls in a for loop. And that was where it all went wrong.

### Day 7: January 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the above issue with Closures

**Thoughts**: If disappointment was my mood after Day 6, Day 7 was all about jubilaton. I found a way to work around the issue where loops referencing outside functions seem to always get the indexing variable wrong. I used a method called 'closure' - which I must admit, I do not fully understand but only partly - to fix the issue. I must give me some time in the future to learn more in detail about this concept and get a better understanding. I also added few more JavaScript commands to complete the functional elements of the Twitch Watch app.

### Day 8: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Twitch Watch App

**Thoughts**: I missed coding yesterday as I got a lil tied down with other stuff. I could've missed today too, but I was determined not to let go of this commitment, hence I got down to business. Looking forward to working on algorithms tomorrow.
